# Declaration syntax

## Unified declaration syntax

All Cpp2 declarations are written as **"_name_ `:` _kind_ `=` _statement_"**.

- The `:` is pronounced **"is a."**
- The `=` is pronounced **"defined as."**
- The _statement_ is typically an expression statement (e.g., `a + b();`) or a compound statement (e.g., `{ /*...*/ return c(d) / e; }`).
- Various parts of the syntax allow a `_` "don't care" wildcard or can be omitted entirely to accept a default (e.g., `x: int = 0;` can be equivalently written `x: _ = 0;` or `x := 0;` both of which deduce the type).


## Examples

``` cpp title="Example: Consistent declarations â€” name : kind = statement"
// n is a namespace defined as the following scope
n: namespace
= {
    // shape is a type defined as the following scope
    shape: type
    = {
        // points is an object of type std::vector<point2d>,
        // defined as having an empty default value
        // (type-scope objects are private by default)
        points: std::vector<point2d> = ();

        // draw is a function taking 'this' and 'canvas' parameters
        // and returning bool, defined as the following body
        // (type-scope functions are public by default)
        //   - this is as if 'this: shape', an object of type shape
        //   - where is an object of type canvas
        draw: (this, where: canvas) -> bool
        = {
            // pen is an object of deduced (omitted) type 'color',
            // defined as having initial value 'color::red'
            pen := color::red;

            // success is an object of deduced (omitted) type bool,
            // defined as having initial value 'false'
            success := false;

            // ...

            return success;
        }

        // count is a function taking 'this' and returning a type
        // deduced from its body, defined as a single-expression body
        count: (this) = points.ssize();

        // ...
    }

    // color is an @enum type (described later)
    color: @enum type = { red; green; blue; }
}
```
